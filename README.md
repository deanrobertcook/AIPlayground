Putting AI learners into the head of an un-programmed AI bot in a world of problems to solve

A javascript application that provides a checkerboard maze of obstacles and rewards, and a blank bot that needs to be programmed by the user in order to find those rewards and avoid those obstacles.

##Install and run
In order to run the playground, simply clone this repo to anywhere on your computer and then open the index.html file with your browser. Provided that the browser is not too strict on loading local resources, it should run just fine. If, however, you do encounter problems, try running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within the root directory of where you cloned the repo, and then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (you will have to have python installed).
